# YOLOv11 Object Detection
This implementation uses YOLOv11 for real-time and batch object detection on images, videos, and webcam feeds.
# Features
* Install required libraries
* Single Image Detection: Perform object detection on a single image.
* Multiple Image Detection: Process and detect objects in multiple images from a directory.
* Video Detection: Apply YOLOv11 to detect objects in video files.
* Real-time Detection: Perform real-time object detection using a webcam.
# Requirements
Install necessary libraries: ultralytics for YOLOv11 and opencv-python for video and webcam operations.
# Model
* YOLOv11 Model: The object detection model is loaded using YOLO("yolo11n.pt").
* Hardware Support: The model can be run on various hardware platforms (e.g., mps for MacOS, cuda for GPUs, or cpu).
